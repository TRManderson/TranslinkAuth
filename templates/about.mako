<h1>About "No TTCC?"</h1>
<p>"No TTCC?" started as an entry to the <a href="http://uqcs.org.au">UQ Computing Society</a>'s inaugural Hackathon, built by me, <a href="http://trmanderson.com">Tom Manderson</a>, over the course of a weekend. The app started off as being UQ-only, and was completely finished for UQ students about half an hour after the end of the competition (PDFs aren't the easiest plaything). Thanks to some QUT students willing to give me their login details, I was able to expand the app to its current form, servicing QUT, UQ and Griffith! ACU functionality is coming soon, though I'm yet to begin development on it.</p>

<p>Everyone should really know, it's rather infuriating to develop for systems that were designed to keep robots out, which is why it takes ages to load your data from SINet, QUT Virtual, and whatever the Griffith system is called. Fortunately, it's not impossibly long. Progress bars are also a thing (and are on their way).</p>
<p>Special thanks to Carl Foster for keeping me organised during the hackathon, and also for making the first iteration of the website. He's probably very disappointed I started using Bootstrap. Also to Christopher Drake from Elastice for helping out with the idea, and also for the little encouragement talk at the start of the hackathon.</p>
