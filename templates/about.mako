<h1>About "No TTCC?"</h1>
<p>"No TTCC?" started as an entry to the <a href="uqcs.org.au">UQ Computing Society</a>'s inaugural Hackathon, built by me, <a href="trmanderson.com">Tom Manderson</a>, over the course of a weekend. The app started off as being UQ-only, and was completely finished for UQ students about half an hour after the end of the competition (PDFs aren't the easiest plaything). Thanks to some Griffith and QUT students willing to give me their login details, I was able to expand the app to its current form, servicing QUT, Griffith, and UQ.</p>

<p>Everyone should really know, it's a bitch to develop for systems that wered designed to keep robots out, which is why it takes ages to load your data from SINet, QUT Virtual, and whatever the Griffith system is called.</p>
