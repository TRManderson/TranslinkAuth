<h1>About "No TTCC?"</h1>
<p>"No TTCC?" started as an entry to the <a href="http://uqcs.org.au">UQ Computing Society</a>'s inaugural Hackathon, built by me, <a href="http://trmanderson.com">Tom Manderson</a>, over the course of a weekend. The app started off as being UQ-only, and was completely finished for UQ students about half an hour after the end of the competition (PDFs aren't the easiest plaything). Thanks to some QUT students willing to give me their login details, I was able to expand the app to its current form, servicing QUT and UQ. Griffith functionality is on the way (autofilling the form is ready!), but it's proving frustrating to pull timetable data. ACU functionality is also coming soon, though I'm yet to begin development on it.</p>

<p>Everyone should really know, it's rather infuriating to develop for systems that were designed to keep robots out, which is why it takes ages to load your data from SINet, QUT Virtual, and whatever the Griffith system is called. Fortunately, it's not impossibly long. Progress bars are also a thing (and are on their way).</p>
