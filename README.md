=============

UQ Stalkerspace is a hotbed of complaints and embarrassment, and for many, it's the whiniest Facebook group they're a member of. And what's the biggest complaint of the whiniest Facebook group? The Tertiary Transport Concession Card (TTCC).

This app is a solution to some of the problems the TTCC presents to UQ students; we speed up the application process, providing a pre-filled PDF form to submit, as well as providing proof of full-time enrollment in the long run. All this using only your SINet details!
